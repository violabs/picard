# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. There is documentation below to reference. You must include
the documentation as comments. All classes should have their own file in the `v2` package. This will live under
the v2/resources directory. DO NOT add all the properties in the docs above the class.

Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val childConditions: List<ChildCondition>
)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### Map Group Annotations

If there are any properties that contain a entity that has `@GeneratedDsl` that is a value in a map, you should use
`MapGroupTypes.SINGLE`:

```kotlin
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val mappableChild: Map<String, MappableChild>
)

@GeneratedDsl(withMapGroup = GeneratedDsl.MapGroupTypes.SINGLE)
data class MappableChild(...)
```

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion

CronJob
CronJob represents the configuration of a single cron job.
apiVersion: batch/v1

import "k8s.io/api/batch/v1"

CronJob
CronJob represents the configuration of a single cron job.

apiVersion: batch/v1

kind: CronJob

metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

spec (CronJobSpec)

Specification of the desired behavior of a cron job, including the schedule. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

status (CronJobStatus)

Current status of a cron job. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

CronJobSpec
CronJobSpec describes how the job execution will look like and when it will actually run.

jobTemplate (JobTemplateSpec), required

Specifies the job that will be created when executing a CronJob.

JobTemplateSpec describes the data a Job should have when created from a template

jobTemplate.metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object's metadata of the jobs created from this template. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

jobTemplate.spec (JobSpec)

Specification of the desired behavior of the job. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

schedule (string), required

The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.

timeZone (string)

The time zone name for the given schedule, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones. If not specified, this will default to the time zone of the kube-controller-manager process. The set of valid time zone names and the time zone offset is loaded from the system-wide time zone database by the API server during CronJob validation and the controller manager during execution. If no system-wide time zone database can be found a bundled version of the database is used instead. If the time zone name becomes invalid during the lifetime of a CronJob or due to a change in host configuration, the controller will stop creating new new Jobs and will create a system event with the reason UnknownTimeZone. More information can be found in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#time-zones

concurrencyPolicy (string)

Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job. Valid values are:

"Allow" (default): allows CronJobs to run concurrently; - "Forbid": forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous run hasn't finished yet; - "Replace": cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new one
startingDeadlineSeconds (int64)

Optional deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses scheduled time for any reason. Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed ones.

suspend (boolean)

This flag tells the controller to suspend subsequent executions, it does not apply to already started executions. Defaults to false.

successfulJobsHistoryLimit (int32)

The number of successful finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 3.

failedJobsHistoryLimit (int32)

The number of failed finished jobs to retain. Value must be non-negative integer. Defaults to 1.

CronJobStatus
CronJobStatus represents the current state of a cron job.

active ([]ObjectReference)

Atomic: will be replaced during a merge

A list of pointers to currently running jobs.

lastScheduleTime (Time)

Information when was the last time the job was successfully scheduled.

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON. Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

lastSuccessfulTime (Time)

Information when was the last time the job successfully completed.

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON. Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
