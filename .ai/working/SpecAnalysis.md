# Specification Analysis and Feedback

## Overview
This document provides feedback on the `.ai/working/Specification.md` and `.ai/working/TestingSpecification.md` files based on the implementation of ComponentStatusV2. The goal is to identify areas for improvement and clarification to make future implementations smoother.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented ComponentStatusV2 with the following components:
- `ComponentStatusV2` class with proper annotations
- `ComponentCondition` data class with list group support
- Updated APIVersion declarations
- Deprecated v1 ComponentStatus
- Complete test suite following v2 patterns
- All builds and tests passing

## Specification.md Feedback

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Clear Structure Guidelines**: The specification clearly outlined the required annotations (`@GeneratedDsl`, `@DefaultValue`) and their usage.

2. **Good Example**: The CertificateSigningRequestV2 example provided excellent guidance on:
   - Package structure
   - Annotation usage
   - Documentation format
   - Interface declaration pattern

3. **Rules Section**: The rules about Time, Quantity, and camelCase conversion were clear and actionable.

### üîß Areas for Improvement

1. **List Group Annotation Placement**: 
   - **Issue**: The specification states "add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation" for list properties, but doesn't clarify it goes on the class, not the property.
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit example showing `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)` on the class level.

2. **JsonProperty Usage**: 
   - **Issue**: The rule mentions using `@JsonProperty` for preserving original casing but doesn't provide examples.
   - **Recommendation**: Add example showing `@JsonProperty("error")` for fields like `errorValue` where the JSON field name differs from Kotlin property name.

3. **DSL Generation Dependencies**:
   - **Issue**: Not mentioned that adding `withListGroup = true` to nested classes (like ComponentCondition) is necessary for proper DSL generation.
   - **Recommendation**: Clarify that both parent and child classes may need the annotation for complete DSL functionality.

4. **Build Order Dependencies**:
   - **Issue**: Doesn't mention that the build needs to run after creating classes to generate DSL builders before tests can be written.
   - **Recommendation**: Add step indicating "Run build to generate DSL builders before implementing tests."

### üìù Suggested Additions

1. **Troubleshooting Section**: Add common issues like:
   - DSL builders not found ‚Üí need to run build first
   - Compilation errors ‚Üí check annotation placement
   - Missing list group methods ‚Üí verify `withListGroup = true` on both parent and child classes

2. **Complete Workflow**: Add numbered steps:
   1. Create data classes with annotations
   2. Update APIVersion declarations  
   3. Add deprecation to v1
   4. Run clean build
   5. Implement tests
   6. Run tests to verify

## TestingSpecification.md Feedback

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Clear Test Structure**: The guidance about copying existing tests and following the same structure was helpful.

2. **Shared Builder References**: Mentioning `sharedObjectMeta()` and `sharedSelector()` was crucial for consistency.

3. **Import Pattern**: The guidance about using v2 imports was clear.

### üîß Areas for Improvement

1. **Generated Builder Names**:
   - **Issue**: The spec references `ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder` but the actual generated class is `ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder` (which was correct), but this could be confusing.
   - **Recommendation**: Clarify that builder names follow the pattern `{ClassName}DslBuilder`.

2. **DSL Usage Patterns**:
   - **Issue**: Doesn't show how to use the generated list group builders (e.g., `conditions { componentCondition { ... } }`).
   - **Recommendation**: Add example showing nested DSL builder usage for list properties.

3. **Test Constants**:
   - **Issue**: Missing import guidance for `PLACEHOLDER` and other test constants.
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit import statement: `import io.violabs.picard.BuildSim.Companion.PLACEHOLDER`

### üìù Suggested Test Template

Add a complete test template showing:

```kotlin
package io.violabs.picard.v2.resources.cluster.component.status

import io.violabs.picard.BuildSim.Companion.PLACEHOLDER
import io.violabs.picard.Common.OBJECT_META
import io.violabs.picard.Common.sharedObjectMeta
import io.violabs.picard.SuccessBuildSim
import io.violabs.picard.possibilities
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll

class ComponentStatusTest : SuccessBuildSim<ComponentStatusV2, ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder>() {
    companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        @BeforeAll
        fun setup() = buildSetup(
            ComponentStatusTest::class,
            SUCCESS_POSSIBILITIES
        )

        private val SUCCESS_POSSIBILITIES = possibilities<ComponentStatusV2, ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder> {
            scenario {
                id = "minimum"
                given(ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder())
                expected = ComponentStatusV2()
            }

            scenario {
                id = "full"
                given(ComponentStatusV2DslBuilder()) {
                    metadata {
                        sharedObjectMeta()
                    }
                    conditions {
                        componentCondition {
                            status = "True"
                            type = PLACEHOLDER
                            errorValue = PLACEHOLDER
                            message = PLACEHOLDER
                        }
                    }
                }
                expected = ComponentStatusV2(
                    metadata = OBJECT_META,
                    conditions = listOf(
                        ComponentCondition(
                            status = "True",
                            type = PLACEHOLDER,
                            errorValue = PLACEHOLDER,
                            message = PLACEHOLDER
                        )
                    )
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pain Points Encountered

1. **DSL Generation Timing**: Had to run build before tests could compile due to missing generated builders.

2. **List Group Configuration**: Required adding `withListGroup = true` to both parent and child classes for full functionality.

3. **Import Resolution**: Needed to determine correct imports for test constants and shared builders through trial and error.

4. **Builder Method Discovery**: Had to examine generated DSL files to understand available methods and their signatures.

## Recommendations for Future Specifications

1. **Add Prerequisites Section**: List what needs to be installed/available before starting.

2. **Include Verification Steps**: Add commands to verify each step completed successfully.

3. **Common Error Solutions**: Document typical compilation errors and their solutions.

4. **Generated Code References**: Show how to find and examine generated DSL builders for understanding available methods.

5. **End-to-End Example**: Provide a complete minimal example from start to finish for a simple resource.

## Conclusion

The specifications provided good foundational guidance, but would benefit from more detailed examples around DSL generation, test implementation patterns, and troubleshooting common issues. The implementation was successful but required some exploration to resolve gaps in the documentation.
