# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. Refer to the example below for guidance.

### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)
data class ParentResourceV2(...)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion

Lease

Lease
Lease defines a lease concept.

apiVersion: coordination.k8s.io/v1

kind: Lease

metadata (ObjectMeta)

More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

spec (LeaseSpec)

spec contains the specification of the Lease. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

LeaseSpec
LeaseSpec is a specification of a Lease.

acquireTime (MicroTime)

acquireTime is a time when the current lease was acquired.

MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.

holderIdentity (string)

holderIdentity contains the identity of the holder of a current lease. If Coordinated Leader Election is used, the holder identity must be equal to the elected LeaseCandidate.metadata.name field.

leaseDurationSeconds (int32)

leaseDurationSeconds is a duration that candidates for a lease need to wait to force acquire it. This is measured against the time of last observed renewTime.

leaseTransitions (int32)

leaseTransitions is the number of transitions of a lease between holders.

preferredHolder (string)

PreferredHolder signals to a lease holder that the lease has a more optimal holder and should be given up. This field can only be set if Strategy is also set.

renewTime (MicroTime)

renewTime is a time when the current holder of a lease has last updated the lease.

MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.

strategy (string)

Strategy indicates the strategy for picking the leader for coordinated leader election. If the field is not specified, there is no active coordination for this lease. (Alpha) Using this field requires the CoordinatedLeaderElection feature gate to be enabled.

/**

 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509

 *
 * Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 *
 * 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 * 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 * (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain
 * certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
