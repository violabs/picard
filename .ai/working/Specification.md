# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. There is documentation below to reference. You must include
the documentation as comments. All classes should have their own file in the `v2` package. This will live under
the v2/resources directory. DO NOT add all the properties in the docs above the class.

Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val childConditions: List<ChildCondition>
)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### Map Group Annotations

If there are any properties that contain a entity that has `@GeneratedDsl` that is a value in a map, you should use
`MapGroupTypes.SINGLE`:

```kotlin
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val mappableChild: Map<String, MappableChild>
)

@GeneratedDsl(withMapGroup = GeneratedDsl.MapGroupTypes.SINGLE)
data class MappableChild(...)
```

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion

Deployment
Deployment enables declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

spec (DeploymentSpec)

Specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

status (DeploymentStatus)

Most recently observed status of the Deployment.

DeploymentSpec
DeploymentSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Deployment.

selector (LabelSelector), required

Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod template's labels.

template (PodTemplateSpec), required

Template describes the pods that will be created. The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy value is "Always".

replicas (int32)

Number of desired pods. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.

minReadySeconds (int32)

Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

strategy (DeploymentStrategy)

Patch strategy: retainKeys

The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones.

DeploymentStrategy describes how to replace existing pods with new ones.

strategy.type (string)

Type of deployment. Can be "Recreate" or "RollingUpdate". Default is RollingUpdate.

strategy.rollingUpdate (RollingUpdateDeployment)

Rolling update config params. Present only if DeploymentStrategyType = RollingUpdate.

Spec to control the desired behavior of rolling update.

strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge (IntOrString)

The maximum number of pods that can be scheduled above the desired number of pods. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to 25%. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been killed, new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of pods running at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired pods.

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string. When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type. This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable (IntOrString)

The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 25%. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old ReplicaSet can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of pods available at all times during the update is at least 70% of desired pods.

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string. When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type. This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

revisionHistoryLimit (int32)

The number of old ReplicaSets to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

progressDeadlineSeconds (int32)

The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

paused (boolean)

Indicates that the deployment is paused.

DeploymentStatus
DeploymentStatus is the most recently observed status of the Deployment.

replicas (int32)

Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment (their labels match the selector).

availableReplicas (int32)

Total number of available non-terminating pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment.

readyReplicas (int32)

Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this Deployment with a Ready Condition.

unavailableReplicas (int32)

Total number of unavailable pods targeted by this deployment. This is the total number of pods that are still required for the deployment to have 100% available capacity. They may either be pods that are running but not yet available or pods that still have not been created.

updatedReplicas (int32)

Total number of non-terminating pods targeted by this deployment that have the desired template spec.

terminatingReplicas (int32)

Total number of terminating pods targeted by this deployment. Terminating pods have a non-null .metadata.deletionTimestamp and have not yet reached the Failed or Succeeded .status.phase.

This is an alpha field. Enable DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas to be able to use this field.

collisionCount (int32)

Count of hash collisions for the Deployment. The Deployment controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ReplicaSet.

conditions ([]DeploymentCondition)

Patch strategy: merge on key type

Map: unique values on key type will be kept during a merge

Represents the latest available observations of a deployment's current state.

DeploymentCondition describes the state of a deployment at a certain point.

conditions.status (string), required

Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

conditions.type (string), required

Type of deployment condition.

conditions.lastTransitionTime (Time)

Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON. Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

conditions.lastUpdateTime (Time)

The last time this condition was updated.

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON. Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

conditions.message (string)

A human readable message indicating details about the transition.

conditions.reason (string)

The reason for the condition's last transition.

observedGeneration (int64)

The generation observed by the deployment controller.
