# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. There is documentation below to reference. You must include
the documentation as comments. All classes should have their own file in the `v2` package. This will live under
the v2/resources directory. DO NOT add all the properties in the docs above the class.

Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val childConditions: List<ChildCondition>
)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### Map Group Annotations

If there are any properties that contain a entity that has `@GeneratedDsl` that is a value in a map, you should use
`MapGroupTypes.SINGLE`:

```kotlin
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val mappableChild: Map<String, MappableChild>
)

@GeneratedDsl(withMapGroup = GeneratedDsl.MapGroupTypes.SINGLE)
data class MappableChild(...)
```

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion


## Documentation

DaemonSet
DaemonSet represents the configuration of a daemon set.
apiVersion: apps/v1

import "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"

DaemonSet
DaemonSet represents the configuration of a daemon set.

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: DaemonSet

metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

spec (DaemonSetSpec)

The desired behavior of this daemon set. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

status (DaemonSetStatus)

The current status of this daemon set. This data may be out of date by some window of time. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

DaemonSetSpec
DaemonSetSpec is the specification of a daemon set.

selector (LabelSelector), required

A label query over pods that are managed by the daemon set. Must match in order to be controlled. It must match the pod template's labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

template (PodTemplateSpec), required

An object that describes the pod that will be created. The DaemonSet will create exactly one copy of this pod on every node that matches the template's node selector (or on every node if no node selector is specified). The only allowed template.spec.restartPolicy value is "Always". More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller#pod-template

minReadySeconds (int32)

The minimum number of seconds for which a newly created DaemonSet pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).

updateStrategy (DaemonSetUpdateStrategy)

An update strategy to replace existing DaemonSet pods with new pods.

DaemonSetUpdateStrategy is a struct used to control the update strategy for a DaemonSet.

updateStrategy.type (string)

Type of daemon set update. Can be "RollingUpdate" or "OnDelete". Default is RollingUpdate.

updateStrategy.rollingUpdate (RollingUpdateDaemonSet)

Rolling update config params. Present only if type = "RollingUpdate".

Spec to control the desired behavior of daemon set rolling update.

updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge (IntOrString)

The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1. Default value is 0. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits. Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may cause evictions during disruption.

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string. When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type. This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable (IntOrString)

The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0 Default value is 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available, it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least 70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during the update.

IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string. When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type. This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

revisionHistoryLimit (int32)

The number of old history to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

DaemonSetStatus
DaemonSetStatus represents the current status of a daemon set.

numberReady (int32), required

numberReady is the number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running with a Ready Condition.

numberAvailable (int32)

The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)

numberUnavailable (int32)

The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have none of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)

numberMisscheduled (int32), required

The number of nodes that are running the daemon pod, but are not supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

desiredNumberScheduled (int32), required

The total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (including nodes correctly running the daemon pod). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

currentNumberScheduled (int32), required

The number of nodes that are running at least 1 daemon pod and are supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

updatedNumberScheduled (int32)

The total number of nodes that are running updated daemon pod

collisionCount (int32)

Count of hash collisions for the DaemonSet. The DaemonSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

conditions ([]DaemonSetCondition)

Patch strategy: merge on key type

Map: unique values on key type will be kept during a merge

Represents the latest available observations of a DaemonSet's current state.

DaemonSetCondition describes the state of a DaemonSet at a certain point.

conditions.status (string), required

Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

conditions.type (string), required

Type of DaemonSet condition.

conditions.lastTransitionTime (Time)

Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.

Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON. Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

conditions.message (string)

A human readable message indicating details about the transition.

conditions.reason (string)

The reason for the condition's last transition.

observedGeneration (int64)

The most recent generation observed by the daemon set controller.
