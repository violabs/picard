# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. Refer to the example below for guidance.

### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)
data class ParentResourceV2(...)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion

LeaseCandidate v1beta1
LeaseCandidate defines a candidate for a Lease object.
apiVersion: coordination.k8s.io/v1beta1

import "k8s.io/api/coordination/v1beta1"

LeaseCandidate
LeaseCandidate defines a candidate for a Lease object. Candidates are created such that coordinated leader election will pick the best leader from the list of candidates.

apiVersion: coordination.k8s.io/v1beta1

kind: LeaseCandidate

metadata (ObjectMeta)

More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

spec (LeaseCandidateSpec)

spec contains the specification of the Lease. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

LeaseCandidateSpec
LeaseCandidateSpec is a specification of a Lease.

binaryVersion (string), required

BinaryVersion is the binary version. It must be in a semver format without leading v. This field is required.

leaseName (string), required

LeaseName is the name of the lease for which this candidate is contending. The limits on this field are the same as on Lease.name. Multiple lease candidates may reference the same Lease.name. This field is immutable.

strategy (string), required

Strategy is the strategy that coordinated leader election will use for picking the leader. If multiple candidates for the same Lease return different strategies, the strategy provided by the candidate with the latest BinaryVersion will be used. If there is still conflict, this is a user error and coordinated leader election will not operate the Lease until resolved.

emulationVersion (string)

EmulationVersion is the emulation version. It must be in a semver format without leading v. EmulationVersion must be less than or equal to BinaryVersion. This field is required when strategy is "OldestEmulationVersion"

pingTime (MicroTime)

PingTime is the last time that the server has requested the LeaseCandidate to renew. It is only done during leader election to check if any LeaseCandidates have become ineligible. When PingTime is updated, the LeaseCandidate will respond by updating RenewTime.

MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.

renewTime (MicroTime)

RenewTime is the time that the LeaseCandidate was last updated. Any time a Lease needs to do leader election, the PingTime field is updated to signal to the LeaseCandidate that they should update the RenewTime. Old LeaseCandidate objects are also garbage collected if it has been hours since the last renew. The PingTime field is updated regularly to prevent garbage collection for still active LeaseCandidates.

MicroTime is version of Time with microsecond level precision.

 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509

 *
 * Kubelets use this API to obtain:

 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 * 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 * (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain
 * certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
