# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. There is documentation below to reference. You must include
the documentation as comments. All classes should have their own file in the `v2` package. This will live under
the v2/resources directory. DO NOT add all the properties in the docs above the class.

Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val childConditions: List<ChildCondition>
)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### Map Group Annotations

If there are any properties that contain a entity that has `@GeneratedDsl` that is a value in a map, you should use
`MapGroupTypes.SINGLE`:

```kotlin
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val mappableChild: Map<String, MappableChild>
)

@GeneratedDsl(withMapGroup = GeneratedDsl.MapGroupTypes.SINGLE)
data class MappableChild(...)
```

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion


## Documentation

ControllerRevision
ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data.
apiVersion: apps/v1

import "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"

ControllerRevision
ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data. Clients are responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects that contain their internal state. Once a ControllerRevision has been successfully created, it can not be updated. The API Server will fail validation of all requests that attempt to mutate the Data field. ControllerRevisions may, however, be deleted. Note that, due to its use by both the DaemonSet and StatefulSet controllers for update and rollback, this object is beta. However, it may be subject to name and representation changes in future releases, and clients should not depend on its stability. It is primarily for internal use by controllers.

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: ControllerRevision

metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

revision (int64), required

Revision indicates the revision of the state represented by Data.

data (RawExtension)

Data is the serialized representation of the state.

*RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.

To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin types.

// Internal package:

type MyAPIObject struct { runtime.TypeMeta json:",inline" MyPlugin runtime.Object json:"myPlugin" }

type PluginA struct { AOption string json:"aOption" }

// External package:

type MyAPIObject struct { runtime.TypeMeta json:",inline" MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension json:"myPlugin" }

type PluginA struct { AOption string json:"aOption" }

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this:

{ "kind":"MyAPIObject", "apiVersion":"v1", "myPlugin": { "kind":"PluginA", "aOption":"foo", }, }

So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)*

/**

 *
 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509
 * certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it
 * asynchronously approved and issued.
 *
 * Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 *
 * 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 * 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 * (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain
 * certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
