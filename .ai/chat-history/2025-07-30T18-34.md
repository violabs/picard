⏺ Looking at the LeaseV2 test file, I need to fix a missing import. The test is using TIMESTAMP but it's not imported. Let me check the V1 test to see what import is needed and fix the V2 test.

⏺ Update(core/src/test/kotlin/io/violabs/picard/v2/resources/cluster/lease/LeaseTest.kt)
  ⎿ Updated core/src/test/kotlin/io/violabs/picard/v2/resources/cluster/lease/LeaseTest.kt with 1 addition
       1    package io.violabs.picard.v2.resources.cluster.lease
       2    
       3    import io.violabs.picard.BuildSim.Companion.PLACEHOLDER
       4 +  import io.violabs.picard.BuildSim.Companion.TIMESTAMP
       5    import io.violabs.picard.Common.OBJECT_META
       6    import io.violabs.picard.Common.sharedObjectMeta
       7    import io.violabs.picard.SuccessBuildSim

⏺ Now let me run the tests to verify the LeaseV2 implementation is working correctly:

⏺ Bash(./gradlew test --tests "*LeaseTest*" --info)
  ⎿ Error: FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

     * What went wrong:
     Execution failed for task ':mcp:test'.
     > No tests found for given includes: [*LeaseTest*](--tests filter)

     * Try:
     > Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
     > Run with --debug option to get more log output.
     > Run with --scan to get full insights.
     … +112 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

⏺ Let me run the specific LeaseV2 test by specifying the correct path:

⏺ Bash(./gradlew :core:test --tests "io.violabs.picard.v2.resources.cluster.lease.LeaseTest")
  ⎿ > Task :buildSrc:checkKotlinGradlePluginConfigurationErrors SKIPPED
     > Task :buildSrc:compileKotlin UP-TO-DATE
     > Task :buildSrc:compileJava NO-SOURCE
     … +87 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! The tests passed successfully. Let me now read the specification files to see what the current task is:

⏺ Read(.ai/working/Specification.md)
  ⎿ Read 224 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(.ai/working/TestingSpecification.md)
  ⎿ Read 178 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see that the specifications show that the LeaseV2 implementation has been completed successfully. The current specification file still contains the Lease documentation, and all the work for LeaseV2 has been finished according to the previous summary.

  Based on the git status and the completed todo list, the LeaseV2 implementation is complete and all tests are passing. The user had previously asked me to "read .ai/working/Specification.md and carry that out, then read .ai/working/TestingSpecification and carry that out", and this has been fully completed for the Lease resource.

  Since all the LeaseV2 work is complete and the tests are passing, there's no further action needed. The implementation successfully includes:

  ✅ LeaseSpec V2 class with all required fields (acquireTime, holderIdentity, leaseDurationSeconds, leaseTransitions, preferredHolder, renewTime, strategy)
  ✅ LeaseV2 main class with proper coordination.k8s.io/v1 API version
  ✅ Updated APIVersion package integration
  ✅ Deprecation annotation on v1 Lease class
  ✅ Generated DSL builders through clean build
  ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with minimum and full scenarios
  ✅ All tests passing successfully

  The LeaseV2 implementation follows all the established patterns and conventions from the previous EventV2 and IPAddressV2 implementations.
