# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)
data class ParentResourceV2(...)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion


## Documentation

RuntimeClass
RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster.
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1

import "k8s.io/api/node/v1"

RuntimeClass
RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster. The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are manually defined by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod. For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/

apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1

kind: RuntimeClass

metadata (ObjectMeta)

More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

handler (string), required

handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are specific to the node & CRI configuration. It is assumed that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable.

overhead (Overhead)

overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass. For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/

Overhead structure represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod.

overhead.podFixed (map[string]Quantity)

podFixed represents the fixed resource overhead associated with running a pod.

scheduling (Scheduling)

scheduling holds the scheduling constraints to ensure that pods running with this RuntimeClass are scheduled to nodes that support it. If scheduling is nil, this RuntimeClass is assumed to be supported by all nodes.

Scheduling specifies the scheduling constraints for nodes supporting a RuntimeClass.

scheduling.nodeSelector (map[string]string)

nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause the pod to be rejected in admission.

scheduling.tolerations ([]Toleration)

Atomic: will be replaced during a merge

tolerations are appended (excluding duplicates) to pods running with this RuntimeClass during admission, effectively unioning the set of nodes tolerated by the pod and the RuntimeClass.

The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator .

scheduling.tolerations.key (string)

Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

scheduling.tolerations.operator (string)

Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

scheduling.tolerations.value (string)

Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

scheduling.tolerations.effect (string)

Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

scheduling.tolerations.tolerationSeconds (int64)

TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509

 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
