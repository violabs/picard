# Working Specifications

## Prerequisites

- Access to the Picard codebase
- Gradle build environment set up
- Understanding of Kotlin and Kubernetes resource structure

## Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Create data classes** with proper annotations
2. **Update APIVersion declarations** to include V2 versions
3. **Add deprecation** to v1 classes
4. **Run clean build** to generate DSL builders
5. **Implement tests** using generated builders
6. **Run tests** to verify implementation

## Instruct

Build out objects with a specific format.
They should utilize `GeneratedDsl` and `DefaultValue` annotations. These items represent top
level Kubernetes resources, and should be structured to include the `apiVersion`, `metadata`, and
any specific fields relevant to the resource. There is documentation below to reference. You must include
the documentation as comments. All classes should have their own file in the `v2` package.

Refer to the example below for guidance. When you are finished,
add items to .git.


### List Group Annotations

If there is a list property that needs DSL builder support, add `withListGroup = true` to the `GeneratedDsl` annotation **on the class level**:

```kotlin
// For the parent class that contains the list
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val childConditions: List<ChildCondition>
)

// For the child class that will be in the list
@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true) 
data class ChildCondition(...)
```

This generates both `conditions(vararg items: ChildCondition)` and `conditions { childCondition { ... } }` DSL methods.

### Map Group Annotations

If there are any properties that contain a entity that has `@GeneratedDsl` that is a value in a map, you should use
`MapGroupTypes.SINGLE`:

```kotlin
@GeneratedDsl
data class ParentResource(
    val mappableChild: Map<String, MappableChild>
)

@GeneratedDsl(withMapGroup = GeneratedDsl.MapGroupTypes.SINGLE)
data class MappableChild(...)
```

### JsonProperty Usage

When field names need to preserve original JSON casing that differs from Kotlin conventions:

```kotlin
data class ComponentCondition(
    val status: String,
    val type: String,
    @JsonProperty("error")  // JSON field is "error", Kotlin property is "errorValue"
    val errorValue: String? = null,
    val message: String? = null
)
```

### APIVersion Integration

You will need to look at the package `io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.APIVersion` to
add the V2 version as an extension of the existing version.

### Deprecation

Finally, update the v1 to have `@Deprecated("Use v2", ReplaceWith(<package for v2>))`

## Rules

- Time = LocalDateTime
- Quantity = io.violabs.picard.domain.k8sResources.Quantity
- Capitalized acronyms and initialisms should use camelCase (e.g., `APIService` -> `ApiService`, `CA` -> `Ca`)
  - Use `@JsonProperty` for properties to preserve the original casing if necessary.
  - Override `getKind(): String` to return the original casing for the kind if it extends a Resource

## Build Process

When you are finished creating the files:

1. **First**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` to generate DSL builders
2. **Then**: Implement tests using the generated builders
3. **Finally**: Run `./gradlew test` to verify everything works

If you do not fix the build after 3 times, you can ask for help.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DSL builders not found during test compilation**
   - **Solution**: Run `./gradlew clean build -x test` first to generate the DSL classes

2. **Missing list group methods (e.g., `conditions { ... }`)**
   - **Solution**: Ensure both parent and child classes have `@GeneratedDsl(withListGroup = true)`

3. **JsonProperty compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty`

4. **APIVersion compilation errors**
   - **Solution**: Verify the import was added and the Version interface extends APIVersion

ResourceClaimTemplate v1beta2
ResourceClaimTemplate is used to produce ResourceClaim objects.
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta2

import "k8s.io/api/resource/v1beta2"

ResourceClaimTemplate
ResourceClaimTemplate is used to produce ResourceClaim objects.

This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta2

kind: ResourceClaimTemplate

metadata (ObjectMeta)

Standard object metadata

spec (ResourceClaimTemplateSpec), required

Describes the ResourceClaim that is to be generated.

This field is immutable. A ResourceClaim will get created by the control plane for a Pod when needed and then not get updated anymore.

ResourceClaimTemplateSpec
ResourceClaimTemplateSpec contains the metadata and fields for a ResourceClaim.

spec (ResourceClaimSpec), required

Spec for the ResourceClaim. The entire content is copied unchanged into the ResourceClaim that gets created from this template. The same fields as in a ResourceClaim are also valid here.

metadata (ObjectMeta)

ObjectMeta may contain labels and annotations that will be copied into the ResourceClaim when creating it. No other fields are allowed and will be rejected during validation.

/**
 * https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/certificate-signing-request-v1/
 *
 * CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509
 * certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it
 * asynchronously approved and issued.
 *
 * Kubelets use this API to obtain:
 *
 * 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName).
 * 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely
 *    (with the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName).
 *
 * This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver
 * (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain
 * certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers.
 *
